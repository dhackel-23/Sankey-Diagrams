# Sankey-Diagrams

All files are part of the open-source Python package Floweaver, created by Rick Lupton. Since it's open source, anyone is welcome to contribute.

In this project, I explored the idea of hiding certain flows to help declutter Sankey diagrams. I used two main functions from the diagram_optimisation class (credit goes to Rick again), making minor modifications to return all crossing flows along with their corresponding crossing areas. These outputs are then used in the smart remover test and fruit files.

There are four CSV files included:

test_flows.csv and test_processes.csv: small test datasets
synthetic_fruit_flows.csv and synthetic_fruit_processes.csv: larger, synthetic datasets
