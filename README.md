# Sankey-Diagrams

# All the files are part of the open python packge floweaver created by Rick Lupton. Its open source so anyone can contribute. I explored the idea of hiding certain flows, which would help declutter sankey diagrams. I used 2 main functions in the diagram_optimisation class (credit goes to Rick again) I simply made minor changes to return all the flows that crossed as well as their correspodning crossing area. This is then used in the smart remover test and fruit files. I have 4 csv file. 2 test files (test_flows, test_processes), and 2 synthetic data files with a larger dataset (synthetic_fruit_flows, synthetic_fruit_processes).
